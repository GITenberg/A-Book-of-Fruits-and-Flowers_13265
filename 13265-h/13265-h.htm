<p>
Take Lemmons, rub them upon a Grate, to make their
rinds smooth, cut them in halves, take out the meat
of them, and boyle them in faire water a good
while, changing the water once or twice in the
boyling, to take away the bitternesse of them, when
they are tender take them out and scrape away all the meat (if
any be left) very cleane, then cut them as thin as you can (to
make them hold) in a long string, or in reasonable short pieces,
and lay them in your glasse, and boyling some of the best <i>White</i>-wine
vineger with shugar, to a reasonable thin Syrupe, powre
it upon them into your glasse, and keep them for your use.
</p>

<h3 class="p">To Preserve Oranges or Lemmons.</h3>

<p>
Take your <i>Oranges</i> or <i>Lemmons</i>, lay them in water three dayes,
and three nights, to take away their bitternesse, then boyle them
in faire water till they be tender, make as much Syrupe for them
as will make them swim about the pan, let them not boyle too
long therein, for it will make the skins tough; then let them lie
all night in the Syrupe, to make them take the Syrupe in the
morning, boyle the Syrupe to his thicknesse, and put them in
gally pots or glasses, to keep all the yeare, and this is the best way
to Preserve <i>Orenges, Lemmons</i>, or <i>Citrons</i>.

you will, on a sheet of white paper, dry it in an Oven, and

<h2 class="p">Of Quinces.</h2>


<h3 class="p">The best way to Preserve Quinces.</h3>

<p>
First pare and coare the <i>Quinces</i>, and boyle them in faire water
till they be very tender, not covering them, then taking them
out of the water, take to every pound of them, two pound of <i>Sugar</i>,
and half a pint of water, boyle it to a Syrupe, scumming it well,
then put in some of the Jelly that is washed from the <i>Quince</i> kernels,
and after that, making it boyle a little, put in your <i>Quinces</i>,
boyle them very fast, keeping the holes upward as neer as you
can, for fear of breaking, and when they are so tender that you
may thrust a rush through them, take them off, and put them up
in your glasses, having first saved some Syrupe till it be cold to fill
up your glasses.
</p>

<h3 class="p">A speciall Remembrance in doing them.</h3>

<p>
When you Preserve <i>Quinces</i>, or make <i>Marmalade</i>, take the Kernels
out of the raw <i>Quinces</i>, and wash off the Jelly that groweth
about them, in faire water, then straine the water and Jelly from
the kernels, through some fine Cobweb laune, and put the same
into the <i>Marmalade</i>, or preserved <i>Quinces</i>, when they are well
scum'd, but put not so much into your <i>Quinces</i>, as into the <i>Marmalade</i>,
for it will Jelly the Syrupe too much; put six or seven
spoonfulls of Syrupe into the Jelly. Before you put it into the
<i>Marmalade</i>, you must boyle your <i>Quinces</i> more for <i>Marmalade</i>, then
to preserve your <i>Quinces</i>, and least of them when you make your
clear Cakes.
</p>
<p>
When you would preserve your <i>Quinces</i> white, you must not
cover them in the boyling, and you must put halfe as much <i>Sugar</i>
more for the white, as for the other. When you would have them
red, you must cover them in the boyling.
</p>

in faire water, till they be soft, but not too violently for feare you
break them, when they are soft take them out, and boyle some
<i>Quinces</i> pared, quarter'd, and coar'd, and the parings of the <i>Quinces</i>
with them in the same liquor, to make it strong, and when
they have boyled a good time, enough to make the liquor of
sufficient strength, take out the quartered <i>Quinces</i> and parings,
and put the liquor into a pot big enough to receive all the <i>Quinces</i>,
both whole and quartered, and put them into it, when the
liquor is thorow cold, and so keep them for your use close
covered.
</p>

<h3 class="p">To make Quince Cakes.</h3>

<p>
Prepare your <i>Quinces</i>, and take the just weight of them in <i>Sugar</i>,
beaten finely, and searcing halfe of it, then of the rest make
a Syrupe, using the ordinary proportion of a pint of water to a
pound of <i>Sugar</i>, let your <i>Quinces</i> be well beaten, and when the
Syrupe is cand height, put in your <i>Quince</i>, and boyle it to a past,
keeping it with continuall stirring, then work it up with the beaten
<i>Sugar</i> which you reserved, and these Cakes will tast well of the
<i>Quinces</i>.

substance run through a faire linnen cloath into a clean bason,
then put it into a posnet, and let it boyle till it come to a jelly,
then Print it in your Moulds, and turne it into your boxes. You

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
